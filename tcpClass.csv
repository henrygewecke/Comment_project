AP Calculus AB,Biology
"We covered the topics of limits, continuity, and differentiation and began the study of integration, which we will continue into the second semester. In addition to daily homework and frequent quizzes, we had three in-class unit tests, a cumulative final exam, and two projects, one on predicting stock prices using derivatives and one on modeling fluid flow using related rates and Torricelliâ€™s Law.","We learned about how to dissect fish, make sushi, and identify parts of a plant. We concluded the semester with a field trip around Portland, asking restaurant owners about how they try to be sustainable."
